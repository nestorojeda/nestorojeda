### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is NÃ©stor, and I'm a computer science engineer based in the Canary Islands. My main area of specialization is software engineering, but i'm very interested in computer vision and machine learning. 
As a professional, most of my experience has been working as a Full Stack Developer, using PHP and Vue.js, but I'm also profficient at Python, which I used on my degree's thesis.
